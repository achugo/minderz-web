            3. Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect: When you
            access our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally
            identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web
            pages viewed, browser type, operating system, referring service,
            search information, device type, page views, usage and browsing
            habits on the Service and similar data. We may also aggregate
            demographic information collected from our users (such as the number
            of users in a particular geographical location) in a manner which
            does not identify any one individual. We may also aggregate
            information collected offline in connection with the Service, obtain
            non-personally identifiable information from third party sources and
            develop aggregate information by anonymizing previously collected
            personally identifiable information.

            4. It is possible at times when collecting non-personally
            identifiable information through automatic means that we may
            unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable
            information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable
            information. While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such
            incidental data collection, the possibility still exists. If you
            believe that we have inadvertently collected your personal
            information, please notify us at hello@minderz.co.
